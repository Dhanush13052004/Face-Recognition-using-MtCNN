# Face-Recognition-using-MtCNN

# Introduction
A face recognition system combines detection and recognition techniques to capture facial images and convert them into unique face prints for applications like security and verification. MTCNN efficiently detects and isolates faces, while recognition algorithms classify them based on distinctive features. The process involves image acquisition, detection using MTCNN, and recognition using CNNs with TensorFlow and TFlearn. This robust system enhances security by identifying individuals through automated facial recognition.

# Project Goals
The main goal of the project is to develop a robust face recognition system that accurately detects and recognizes individuals based on unique facial features. Applications include enhancing security in public spaces, enabling person verification, and preventing criminal activities. It can be used in surveillance systems, attendance management, and secure access control. This system is crucial for improving safety and operational efficiency across various domains.
